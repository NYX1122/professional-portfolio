# professional-portfolio
This page is a template for my portfolio that I'm sure I will change in many ways before the class is over. It is in a very early state and I'm actually in the process of designing a unique layout that I will implement in the future. This page is simply the best I could replicate with the gif of the mockup that I was given.
